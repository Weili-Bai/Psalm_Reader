char* cha1="Blessed is the man\nwho walks not in the counsel of the wicked\nnor stands in the way of sinners,\nnor sits in the seat of scoffers;\nbut his delight is in the law of the Lord,\nand on his law he meditates day and night.\nHe is like a tree\nplanted by streams of water\nthat yields its fruit in its season,\nand its leaf does not wither.\nIn all that he does, he prospers.\nThe wicked are not so,\nbut are like chaff that the wind drives away.\nTherefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,\nnor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;\nfor the Lord knows the way of the righteous,\nbut the way of the wicked will perish.\n";
char* cha2="Why do the nations rage\nand the peoples plot in vain?\nThe kings of the earth set themselves,\nand the rulers take counsel together,\nagainst the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,\n“Let us burst their bonds apart\nand cast away their cords from us.”\nHe who sits in the heavens laughs;\nthe Lord holds them in derision.\nThen he will speak to them in his wrath,\nand terrify them in his fury, saying,\n“As for me, I have set my King\non Zion, my holy hill.”\nI will tell of the decree:\nThe Lord said to me, “You are my Son;\ntoday I have begotten you.\nAsk of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,\nand the ends of the earth your possession.\nYou shall break them with a rod of iron\nand dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”\nNow therefore, O kings, be wise;\nbe warned, O rulers of the earth.\nServe the Lord with fear,\nand rejoice with trembling.\nKiss the Son,\nlest he be angry, and you perish in the way,\nfor his wrath is quickly kindled.\nBlessed are all who take refuge in him.\n";
